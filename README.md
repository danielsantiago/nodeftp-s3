s3nodeftpd - a simple FTP server with S3 as the storage backend written in Node.JS
====

Welcome
----

Forked from nodeftpd on github.

This is still a very fresh fork, so still working on the aws-swk node.js code to make s3 as the backend storage container.

Set your local environment variables for AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. This might change in a furture release.
